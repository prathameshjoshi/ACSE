Its leaves offer feed for migrating herbivores and for domestic   livestock. The mature African Blackwood trees are capable of surviving fires   that destroy other vegetation in grasslands. The dark heartwood of Mpingo, is   one of the most economically valuable timbers in the world.<p><strong>B</strong></p><p><strong>Bois dentelle</strong> is a beautiful tree, endemic to the high cloud forest of   Mauritius. Despite the fact that it has no commercial value, only two   individuals are left. The most remarkable thing about the species are the   flowers &ndash; sprays of white bell flowers with fine lacy petals that cover the tree   in summer (January &ndash;March).</p><p><strong>C</strong><p><strong>The Clanwilliam cedar</strong> is a species endemic to the Cederberg Mountains   in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. A majestic tree of 6-18 meters in   height, the Clanwilliam cedar is a rot-resistant, fragrant and visually   beautiful timber that was extensively exploited for building, furniture and   later on telegraph poles by European settlers in the eighteenth century.</p> <p><strong>D</strong><p><strong>The Dragon Tree</strong> is found on the Canary Islands, Cape Verde Islands,   Madeira and Morocco. The Guanche people of the Canary Islands used the sap for   mummification purposes. In Ancient Rome, Sangre de Drago (Dragon Tree) was used   as a colorant and across Europe it has been used as a varnish for iron tools.</p><p>According to the Greek myth, The Eleventh Labor of Hercules: The Apples of   the Hesp&eacute;rides, the hundred-headed dragon, Landon, who was said to have been   the guardian of the Garden of the Hesp&eacute;rides, was killed by either Hercules or   Atlas in order to fulfill Hercules&rsquo; task to bring back three golden apples from   the garden. As told in the myth, the trees known as 'Dragon Trees&rsquo; sprung from   Landon's red blood, which flowed out upon the land.</p><p>The species is classified as being Endangered by Cape Verde, while it is   identified as being extinct in the wild on Brava and Santiago where only planted   specimens exist today.</p><p><strong>H</strong><p><strong>The Honduras rosewood</strong> is found in Belize in Central America and   produces timber, which is extremely valued on the world market because of its   use in musical instrument production.</p><p>Since the Honduras Rosewood supplies hard, heavy, durable and very resonant   timber, when struck, it gives off a clear, loud note and making it itself most   highly valued in the production of orchestral xylophones and claves. It is also   used to make thin covering for fine furniture and cabinets, , knife handles etc.</p><p><strong>L</strong></p><p><strong>The Loulu </strong>is a palm endemic to the northernmost of the Hawaiian   Islands chain with the most variety of plant species of any island in Hawaii.   There are fewer than 300 individuals of the Loulu left, because of limited   regeneration caused by seed predation by rats and pigs as well as competing   plants.</p><p><strong>M</strong><p><strong>The Monkey Puzzle</strong> is the National Tree of Chile. Nevertheless, there   is at least of these trees in every botanical garden in Europe. Its local name   is Pehu&eacute;n and its existence has great historical and social importance to the   people living in that area known as the Pehuenche, which means &ldquo;people of   Pehu&eacute;n&rdquo;. The seeds of the tree shape an important part of their diet.</p><p>The Monkey puzzle is also valued for its unique and natural beauty, which   makes it an emblem of a national parks and provinces in both Chile and   Argentina. The timber found from the Pehu&eacute;n has a high mechanical resistance and   moderate resistance to fungal decay, hence for its being used for beams in   buildings, bridges, roofs, furniture, boat structures, thin covering etc. Monkey   puzzle forests have been fast destroyed and degraded due to logging, fire and   grazing.</p><p><strong>N</strong></p><p><strong>Nubian Dragon Tree</strong> is found in Djibouti, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan,   and Uganda and was once a widespread and abundant species.</p><p>It is one of the few species that can survive wide periods of drought in all   parts of its scope, hence making it an important part of the desert ecosystem.   The mature fruits of the Nubian Dragon tree are eaten and its sap and fruit may   also have medicinal properties.</p><p><strong>P</strong></p><p><strong>Pau brasil</strong> is the national tree of Brazil, making it have strong   cultural links to Brazil&rsquo;s social and economic history. The species is known for   the dye extract taken from the heartwood, for which it has been exploited since   1501. Presently, the dye extract and its bark are used locally for medicinal   purposes. Research is being carried out to find out whether the bark of this   tree can be used as a cure for cancer.</p><p>Pau brasil wood is hard and compact, which is almost indestructible and was   traditionally used to make hunting tools; commercially, it was harvested for use   as a construction timber and in craftwork. It is also highly valued by musical   instrument makers and still being exported for the production of bows for   stringed instruments.</p><p>The various uses acquired from the Pau Brasil have made it target to   extensive collection and export of the dyewood, resulting in the loss of large   areas of forest and the enslavement of local people and later on the demand for   its timber by bow manufacturers has contributed to a great loss. </p><p><strong>Q</strong><p><strong>Quercus hintonii</strong>, also known as Encino of Hinton (Hinton's Oak), is   endemic to Mexico. Some of the wood&rsquo;s uses range from locally made tool handles,   to beams and fencing poles, and primarily for firewood. Traditionally the wood   is used to bake bread known as las finas, which the distinctive taste is   brought on by the smoke.</p><p>The species has also been highly affected by grazing, which prevents   regeneration as well as the coming up of agriculture, coffee plantation and road   construction have all contributed to the decline in the Quercus hintonii   populations. </p><p><strong>S</strong></p><p><strong>St Helena gumwood</strong> was selected as St. Helena&rsquo;s national tree in 1977.   The endemic floras of St Helena are not only of great biogeographical   significance, but they are also home for equally rare and unusual animal   species. The St. Helena gumwood is one of the fourteen most globally endangered   and endemic tree species in St Helena. It is threatened by human presence and   their use of the timber for firewood and building.</p><p><strong>W</strong></p><p><strong>The Wollemi pine</strong> belongs to the ancient Araucariaceae species, thought   to be over 200 million years old. Until 1994, the Wollemi pine was believed to   have become extinct about 2 million years ago, but it was rediscovered in a   gorge 150 km north-west of Sydney, Australia. There are less than 100 mature   trees in the wild, making it one of the rarest species in the world. Because of   this rarity, the Wollemi attracts a lot of tourism, which threatens its   existence because of the therefore threatened by tourism, for it may be   disturbed by human activities, also exposing it to seeds being trampled,   compaction of the soil, the introduction of weeds and an increase in the   possibility of fires.</p></body></html>";
